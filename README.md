# THE OFFICIAL XATILORE WEBSITE
#### (I did say that I was going to make it one day)

This website has been made from scratch and documents my many projects that I have going on as of now, I didn't want to use a website like Linktree, especially with the bad security it has for its users, so I have resorted to making my own website here on GitHub, and I know that I won't regret it.

Most of the website's HTML and CSS is completely scuffed and that is simply because I am not too experienced in making a responsive-web layout yet, but I promise that on a PC or a tablet the website looks good, and a tiny bit on mobile's landscape mode, but portrait mode is a whole nother story.
