# THE OFFICIAL XATILORE WEBSITE
#### (I did say that I was going to make it one day)

This website has been RE-MADE from scratch and documents my many projects currently going on! I didn't want to use Linktree, as that is too overrated and unoriginal; and it's lack of security for its users even banning them for getting hacked, so I have resorted to making my own website with my CSS and HTML skills obtained from managing Fandom Wikis, I highly encourage making your website on GitHub.

The website used to have scuffed code, but the overhaul completely changes that and makes the website compatible for all users, including PC and Mobile!
Landscape mode and portrait mode will both look good depending on the device you're using while browsing.
